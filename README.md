A simple Python script which takes the FLAC files of a session of ASoT (A State of Trance), and
converts them into Opus, while modifying the file names to my liking.

Dependencies (Debian packages):
- opus-tools

Usage:
- The first argument must be the directory containing the FLAC files to convert.
- The second argument must be the output directory where to put the Opus files.
